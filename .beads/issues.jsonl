{"id":"bsj-1jq","title":"Read agent model from YAML frontmatter instead of hardcoding","description":"# Read Agent Model from YAML Frontmatter Instead of Hardcoding\n\n## Context\nEach agent file in .claude/agents/*.md has YAML frontmatter with a model field:\n```yaml\n---\nname: drummer\ndescription: BEAT — syncopation-obsessed drummer\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n```\n\nBut agent-process-manager.ts hardcodes '--model', 'haiku' at line 178 in spawnAgent(). The YAML frontmatter model value is completely ignored — buildAgentSystemPrompt() strips it at line 230.\n\n## Why This Change\nMaking the .md files the source of truth for model selection:\n1. Enables per-agent model selection (e.g., melody on sonnet for better harmonic reasoning, drums on haiku for speed)\n2. Eliminates the mismatch between documented and actual model\n3. Makes it easy to experiment with different models per agent\n\n## What to Change\n\n### 1. Parse Model from Frontmatter\nIn buildAgentSystemPrompt(), instead of just stripping frontmatter, also extract the model field. Change the method to return both the system prompt and the model:\n\n```typescript\nprivate buildAgentSystemPrompt(agentKey: string): { prompt: string; model: string } | null {\n  const agentFile = AGENT_KEY_TO_FILE[agentKey];\n  if (!agentFile) return null;\n\n  const filePath = path.join(this.workingDir, '.claude', 'agents', `${agentFile}.md`);\n  try {\n    const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');\n    // Extract model from YAML frontmatter\n    const frontmatterMatch = content.match(/^---\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n---/);\n    let model = 'haiku'; // default fallback\n    if (frontmatterMatch) {\n      const modelMatch = frontmatterMatch[1].match(/model:\\s*(\\S+)/);\n      if (modelMatch) model = modelMatch[1];\n    }\n    // Strip frontmatter for system prompt\n    const body = content.replace(/^---[\\s\\S]*?---\\n*/, '');\n    return { prompt: body, model };\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(`[AgentManager] Failed to read agent file: ${filePath}`, err);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Use Extracted Model in spawnAgent()\nUpdate spawnAgent() to use the model from the return value:\n```typescript\nprivate async spawnAgent(key: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  const result = this.buildAgentSystemPrompt(key);\n  if (!result) { ... }\n  const { prompt: systemPrompt, model } = result;\n\n  const proc = spawn('claude', [\n    '--print',\n    '--verbose',\n    '--model', model,  // from frontmatter, not hardcoded\n    // ... rest unchanged\n    '--system-prompt', systemPrompt,\n    // ...\n  ]);\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update Agent Files\nUpdate all 4 .md files to reflect the intended model. Current value is 'sonnet' but agents run on 'haiku'. Decide which model each agent should use and set accordingly. If keeping haiku for all, change to model: haiku.\n\n## Files\n- lib/agent-process-manager.ts (main logic)\n- .claude/agents/drummer.md (update model value)\n- .claude/agents/bassist.md (update model value)\n- .claude/agents/melody.md (update model value)\n- .claude/agents/fx-artist.md (update model value)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Model is read from YAML frontmatter in each .md file\n- Falls back to 'haiku' if no model field exists\n- spawnAgent() uses the extracted model instead of hardcoded 'haiku'\n- All 4 .md files have correct model values\n- Console log shows which model each agent is using\n- No TypeScript compilation errors","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:38:41.047407+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-24T15:34:21.35207+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-09T17:55:11.275073+08:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bsj-1jq","depends_on_id":"bsj-omb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:39:16.55378+08:00","created_by":"Desmond"}]}

{"id":"bsj-5ku","title":"Expand Strudel toolkit with energy templates and density rules","description":"# Expand Strudel Toolkit with Energy Templates and Density Rules\n\n## Context\nEach agent prompt in .claude/agents/*.md has a \u003cstrudel_toolkit\u003e section with ~10 lines of Strudel code examples. Strudel is a niche DSL (TidalCycles-inspired browser synth). Claude Haiku generates Strudel code using only this thin reference. This leads to frequent syntax errors, invalid function usage, and patterns that fail to evaluate in the browser.\n\n## Why This Change\nAgents need a richer vocabulary to generate valid, diverse patterns. The toolkit should cover more functions, show anti-patterns (what NOT to do), provide energy-keyed templates, and set density constraints tied to energy level.\n\n## What to Change (per agent)\n\n### 1. Expand \u003cstrudel_toolkit\u003e (~30-40 lines)\nAdd more Strudel functions relevant to each agent's role:\n- Drums: .struct(), .euclid() variations, .mask(), multiple bank options\n- Bass: .legato(), .sustain(), octave patterns, .slide()\n- Melody: .arp(), .palindrome(), .rev(), .superimpose(), .off()\n- FX: .phaser(), .chorus(), .leslie(), .waveloss(), .shape()\n\n### 2. Add \u003ccommon_errors\u003e section\nPer-agent anti-patterns:\n- ALL: \"Do NOT wrap patterns in markdown code fences (```). Output raw Strudel code in the JSON string.\"\n- Drums: \"NEVER use note() for drums. Use s() only. Invalid: note('c4').s('bd'). Valid: s('bd').bank('RolandTR909')\"\n- Bass: \"NEVER go above c3. NEVER use s() without note(). Invalid: s('sawtooth'). Valid: note('c1').s('sawtooth')\"\n- Melody: \"NEVER go below c4 (that's GROOVE's range). NEVER use s() for drum sounds.\"\n- FX: \"ALWAYS include .hpf(300) or higher. Without it, you'll muddy GROOVE's bass range.\"\n\n### 3. Add energy-band pattern skeletons\nOne template per energy level (low/mid/high) that agents can use as starting points:\n- Drums low (1-3): s(\"bd ~ ~ ~\").bank(\"RolandTR909\")\n- Drums mid (4-6): stack(s(\"bd ~ sd ~\").bank(\"RolandTR909\"), s(\"hh*4\").gain(0.5))\n- Drums high (7-10): stack(s(\"bd [~ bd] sd [bd ~]\").bank(\"RolandTR909\"), s(\"hh*8\").gain(0.5), s(\"~ ~ ~ cp\"))\n(Similar for bass, melody, fx — tailored to each instrument)\n\n### 4. Add density-to-energy rule\nAdd to \u003cmusical_rules\u003e or \u003cstrudel_toolkit\u003e:\n\"Pattern density should match energy: Energy 1-3: use at most 1 layer (no stack). Energy 4-6: up to 2 layers in your own stack(). Energy 7-10: up to 3 layers in your own stack().\"\n\n## Files\n- .claude/agents/drummer.md\n- .claude/agents/bassist.md\n- .claude/agents/melody.md\n- .claude/agents/fx-artist.md\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Each agent's \u003cstrudel_toolkit\u003e has 30+ lines of reference\n- Each agent has a \u003ccommon_errors\u003e section with 3-5 anti-patterns\n- Each agent has 3 energy-band pattern skeletons (low/mid/high)\n- Density rule appears in each file\n- All example patterns in the toolkit are valid Strudel code","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:38:00.144471+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-24T15:34:21.344086+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-09T18:40:29.979374+08:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bsj-5ku","depends_on_id":"bsj-b3m","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:39:15.184675+08:00","created_by":"Desmond"}]}

{"id":"bsj-8n9","title":"Add autonomous tick system for organic jam evolution","description":"# Add Autonomous Tick System for Organic Jam Evolution\n\n## Context\nIn the current architecture, agents ONLY produce new patterns when the boss sends a directive via handleDirective(). After sendJamStart() creates the opening patterns, the jam is frozen until the human intervenes. This contradicts the vision of organic, self-evolving jams.\n\n## Why This Change\nFor jams to evolve autonomously:\n1. Agents need periodic updates showing what the band is currently playing\n2. They need the opportunity to respond (or hold steady with \"no_change\")\n3. The jam should develop a life of its own, with the boss as an optional guide\n\n## Dependencies\n- cc_sick_beats-wfb (no_change sentinel): Agents need to be able to say \"no_change\" during ticks, otherwise every tick forces a pattern change\n- cc_sick_beats-pyk (round number): Ticks should increment the round counter for arc guidance\n\n## What to Change\n\n### 1. Add Tick Timer to AgentProcessManager\nIn lib/agent-process-manager.ts:\n\nAdd a private field:\n```typescript\nprivate tickTimer: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;\nprivate roundNumber = 0;\n```\n\nIn start(), after sendJamStart():\n```typescript\nthis.startAutoTick();\n```\n\nNew method:\n```typescript\nprivate startAutoTick(): void {\n  this.tickTimer = setInterval(() =\u003e {\n    if (this.stopped) return;\n    this.sendAutoTick();\n  }, 30000); // 30 seconds\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Build Auto-Tick Context\nNew method sendAutoTick() — similar to sendJamStart() but framed differently:\n```typescript\nprivate async sendAutoTick(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  this.roundNumber++;\n  const ctx = this.musicalContext;\n\n  const responsePromises = this.activeAgents.map((key) =\u003e {\n    if (!this.agents.has(key)) return Promise.resolve(null);\n\n    const bandStateLines = this.activeAgents\n      .filter((k) =\u003e k !== key)\n      .map((k) =\u003e {\n        const meta = AGENT_META[k];\n        const pattern = this.agentPatterns[k] || 'silence';\n        return `${meta.emoji} ${meta.name} (${k}): ${pattern}`;\n      });\n\n    const context = [\n      `TICK — Round ${this.roundNumber}`,\n      `Key: ${ctx.key} | Scale: ${ctx.scale.join(', ')} | BPM: ${ctx.bpm} | Energy: ${ctx.energy}/10`,\n      '',\n      'BAND STATE:',\n      ...bandStateLines,\n      '',\n      `Your current pattern: ${this.agentPatterns[key] || 'silence'}`,\n      '',\n      'Listen to the band. If the music calls for a change, evolve your pattern.',\n      'If your current groove serves the song, respond with \"no_change\".',\n      'Stability is a musical choice.',\n    ].join('\\n');\n\n    this.setAgentStatus(key, 'thinking');\n    return this.sendToAgentAndCollect(key, context);\n  });\n\n  const responses = await Promise.all(responsePromises);\n  for (let i = 0; i \u003c this.activeAgents.length; i++) {\n    this.applyAgentResponse(this.activeAgents[i], responses[i]);\n  }\n  this.composeAndBroadcast();\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Reset Timer on Boss Directive\nIn handleDirective(), reset the tick timer to avoid double-triggering:\n```typescript\nif (this.tickTimer) {\n  clearInterval(this.tickTimer);\n}\nthis.roundNumber++;\n// ... existing directive logic ...\nthis.startAutoTick(); // Restart timer after directive\n```\n\n### 4. Clean Up on Stop\nIn stop():\n```typescript\nif (this.tickTimer) {\n  clearInterval(this.tickTimer);\n  this.tickTimer = null;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Consider Staggering (optional enhancement)\nInstead of ticking all agents simultaneously, consider staggering:\n- Tick 1 (30s): drums + bass\n- Tick 2 (45s): melody + fx\nThis creates a more organic feel where not everyone changes at once. But this adds complexity — implement the simple version first.\n\n## Files\n- lib/agent-process-manager.ts (main changes)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Auto-tick fires every ~30 seconds during active jam sessions\n- Tick context is framed as \"listen and optionally evolve\" (not \"produce new pattern\")\n- Agents can respond with \"no_change\" (depends on cc_sick_beats-wfb)\n- Round number increments on each tick and directive (depends on cc_sick_beats-pyk)\n- Timer resets when boss sends a directive\n- Timer clears on stop()\n- No memory leaks (interval properly cleaned up)\n- Jam continues to function with boss directives alongside auto-ticks","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:38:53.153856+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-24T15:34:21.343144+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-09T17:55:11.360922+08:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bsj-8n9","depends_on_id":"bsj-omb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:39:16.727928+08:00","created_by":"Desmond"},{"issue_id":"bsj-8n9","depends_on_id":"bsj-wfb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:39:19.043225+08:00","created_by":"Desmond"},{"issue_id":"bsj-8n9","depends_on_id":"bsj-pyk","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:39:19.137241+08:00","created_by":"Desmond"}]}

{"id":"bsj-cj8","title":"Remove comply_with_boss and reframe personas as responsive","description":"# Remove comply_with_boss and Reframe Personas as Responsive\n\n## Context\nEach agent prompt in .claude/agents/*.md has a comply_with_boss boolean in the output schema. Combined with \"stubbornness percentages\" in the persona (e.g., BEAT is \"70% stubborn\"), this creates a mechanic where agents sometimes resist boss directives. The boolean is collected but never used meaningfully downstream — it's broadcast as compliedWithBoss in agent_thought payloads but the UI doesn't act on it.\n\n## Why This Change\nThe project vision has shifted to organic, self-evolving jams where agents always follow directives but express personality through HOW they interpret instructions, not WHETHER they comply. Resistance creates friction without musical value. The new model: agents are responsive listeners who bring their personality to musical decisions, not stubborn holdouts.\n\n## What to Change\n\n### 1. Output Schema (all 4 files)\nRemove the comply_with_boss field. The output schema becomes 3 fields:\n- \"pattern\": Valid Strudel code string, \"silence\" to rest, or \"no_change\" to hold current pattern\n- \"thoughts\": Musical reasoning (visible to other agents next round)\n- \"reaction\": Response to others or the boss (shows personality)\n\n### 2. Persona Section (all 4 files)\nRemove stubbornness percentages and resistance language. Reframe as responsive:\n- BEAT (drummer.md): Remove \"70% stubborn — you often push back\". Add: \"You respond to energy changes by shifting syncopation density. You listen to GROOVE and adjust your kick placement to lock in.\"\n- GROOVE (bassist.md): Remove \"30% stubborn\". Add: \"You mirror BEAT's kick patterns and anchor the harmony. When the music shifts, you provide stability.\"\n- ARIA (melody.md): Remove \"50% stubborn — you'll consider the boss's ideas but won't sacrifice musical integrity\". Add: \"You develop melodic motifs based on the harmonic context. You listen to GROOVE for harmonic foundation and respond to BEAT's energy.\"\n- GLITCH (fx-artist.md): Remove \"60% stubborn\". Add: \"You fill sonic gaps the others leave. You respond to density — when others get busy, you might pull back; when they're sparse, you fill the space.\"\n\n### 3. Examples (all 4 files)\nRemove \"comply_with_boss\": true/false from every example JSON. Example 3 in each file shows resistance — rework these to show creative interpretation instead of refusal. E.g., drummer Example 3 says \"Boss says simpler\" and sets comply_with_boss: false. Rework: the drummer simplifies BUT keeps their personality (e.g., keeps a tom fill, explains WHY in thoughts).\n\n### 4. Fallback (all 4 files)\nRemove \"comply_with_boss\": true from the fallback JSON.\n\n### 5. Code Changes\nIn lib/agent-process-manager.ts:\n- Update AgentResponse interface (line 27-32): remove comply_with_boss field\n- Update broadcastAgentThought (line 490-503): remove compliedWithBoss from payload\nIn lib/types.ts:\n- Update AgentThoughtPayload: remove compliedWithBoss field\nIn components/ (AgentColumn.tsx or similar):\n- Remove any UI rendering of compliedWithBoss\n\n## Files\n- .claude/agents/drummer.md\n- .claude/agents/bassist.md\n- .claude/agents/melody.md\n- .claude/agents/fx-artist.md\n- lib/agent-process-manager.ts\n- lib/types.ts\n- components/AgentColumn.tsx (check for comply rendering)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- comply_with_boss does not appear anywhere in the 4 agent files\n- No stubbornness percentages or resistance language in personas\n- All examples have 3-field JSON (pattern, thoughts, reaction)\n- AgentResponse interface has 3 fields\n- No TypeScript compilation errors\n- Agents always follow boss directives in their prompt guidance","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:37:54.373472+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-24T15:34:21.344358+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-09T18:40:29.710573+08:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bsj-cj8","depends_on_id":"bsj-b3m","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:39:15.096416+08:00","created_by":"Desmond"}]}

For example:\n\"🥁 BEAT (drums): stack(s(\"bd ~ sd ~\").bank(\"RolandTR909\"), s(\"hh*4\").gain(0.5))\"\n\nWhile Haiku can parse Strudel code to some extent, it's not reliable at extracting musical information from complex patterns. A code-level parser could extract structured descriptions:\n- \"Kick on beats 1 and 3, snare on 3, hi-hats on every beat at 50% volume\"\n\n## Why This Would Help\nThe project vision calls for agents to \"listen\" to each other. Currently, listening = reading raw Strudel code. A parsed description would make it easier for agents to identify:\n- Beat positions (where kicks, snares, hats land)\n- Note choices (roots, chord tones, passing tones)\n- Rhythmic density and energy level\n- Sonic space occupied (frequency range, effects)\n\n## Research Questions\n1. Can Strudel patterns be parsed into an AST? Does Strudel expose a parser?\n2. Could a simpler regex-based approach extract key information (note names from note(), sample names from s(), timing from * and [])?\n3. Would a summary be more useful than raw code? E.g., \"BEAT is playing: kick on 1+3, snare on 3, hats every beat, 909 kit, moderate complexity\"\n4. Is the added latency and complexity worth it vs. just giving agents better pattern-reading heuristics in their prompts (currently addressed by cc_sick_beats-lx3)?\n5. Could an LLM call summarize patterns? (adds latency but might be more accurate than regex)\n\n## Scope\nThis is a BACKLOG research task (P4).

Agents need:\n1. A \"no_change\" option so they can acknowledge a tick without changing their pattern (stability is a musical choice, not inactivity)\n2. Awareness of the musical arc tied to round numbers (passed by the code — see cc_sick_beats-pyk)\n3. Guidance on in-pattern variation using Strudel's built-in functions\n4. Understanding that NOT every change in the band requires a response\n\n## Dependency\nThis task depends on cc_sick_beats-cj8 (remove comply_with_boss) because the no_change sentinel replaces the resistance mechanic as the primary agent autonomy mechanism.\n\n## What to Change\nReplace the \u003cpattern_evolution\u003e section in all 4 files with a richer version (~15-20 lines). Content should include:\n\n### no_change Support\n\"If your current pattern serves the song well, respond with pattern: 'no_change'. Your thoughts and reaction should explain WHY you're holding steady. Stability is a deliberate musical choice — a locked-in groove is more valuable than constant change.\"\n\n### Musical Arc (tied to round numbers)\n\"The round number tells you how far into the jam you are:\n- Rounds 1-2: ESTABLISH your voice. Play a foundational pattern for your role.\n- Rounds 3-5: DEVELOP. Listen to what others are playing. Introduce small variations that respond to the band.\n- Round 6+: MATURE. You may introduce surprise elements, strip back for contrast, or hold a groove you've found. The jam has momentum — serve it.\"\n\n### In-Pattern Variation\n\"Use Strudel's built-in variation functions to make even 'static' patterns feel alive:\n- .sometimes(fn): Apply a transformation ~50% of the time\n- .every(N, fn): Transform every N cycles\n- .degradeBy(0.2): Randomly drop 20% of events for human feel\n- .rarely(fn): Apply a transformation ~10% of the time\nThese create organic variation within a single pattern — the sound evolves even if you respond with no_change.\"\n\n### Between-Round Evolution\n\"When you receive updated band state, listen before changing:\n- If another agent made a small tweak, you probably don't need to respond. Hold steady.\n- If the energy level changed, adjust your density/complexity.\n- If a new agent joined or dropped out, adjust your sonic space.\n- If the boss gave a directive, follow it — but only change what's necessary.\"\n\n### Per-Agent Flavor (optional)\nConsider making 1-2 lines per-agent:\n- BEAT: \"Your groove is the foundation.

Currently, agents ONLY respond when the boss sends a directive via handleDirective(). Without boss input, the jam is frozen after the first round — agents never hear what others are playing and never evolve.\n\n## Problem\nFor organic, self-evolving jams, we need:\n1. A periodic auto-tick system that sends updated band state to agents every ~30s, even without boss directives\n2. A \"no_change\" sentinel so agents can acknowledge the tick without changing their pattern (stability is a musical choice)\n3. Round number tracking so agents can follow musical arc guidance (establish → develop → surprise)\n4. Per-agent model selection read from YAML frontmatter (currently hardcoded to 'haiku' at line 178)\n\n## Architecture\n- AgentProcessManager.start() should initialize a setInterval(~30000) after sendJamStart()\n- Each tick sends band state framed as \"listen and optionally evolve\" (NOT \"produce a new pattern\")\n- \"no_change\" response keeps existing agentPatterns[key] unchanged, updates thoughts/reaction only\n- Round counter increments on jam start (0), each tick, and each directive\n- Timer resets on boss directive to avoid double-triggering\n- Timer cleared on stop()\n\n## Files\n- lib/agent-process-manager.ts (main changes)\n- app/api/claude-ws/route.ts (may need tick-related WebSocket handling)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Auto-tick runs every ~30s during active jam sessions\n- Agents can respond with \"no_change\" and their existing pattern continues\n- Round number appears in all context messages sent to agents\n- Model is read from YAML frontmatter with fallback to 'haiku'\n- All subtask issues under this epic completed","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:37:44.442814+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-24T15:34:21.344654+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-09T17:55:05.65281+08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

But there's no guidance for a different failure mode: the agent's PREVIOUS pattern had a syntax error and they need to recover. Currently, if a pattern fails Strudel evaluation, the browser shows an error and the agent has no way to know or fix it.\n\n## Why This Change\nWith the auto-tick system (cc_sick_beats-8n9), agents will be producing patterns more frequently. Error recovery becomes more important because:\n1. More patterns = more chances for syntax errors\n2. The auto-tick could feed error information back to agents in the future\n3. Agents need a strategy for simplifying when things break\n\n## What to Change\nAdd a \u003cdebugging\u003e section to all 4 agent files (~5-8 lines):\n\n\"If you receive feedback that your last pattern had a syntax error, or if you're unsure about your pattern's validity:\n1. Fall back to a known-good pattern from the energy templates in your toolkit\n2. Remove complex effect chains (.delay().crush().coarse() → just .delay())\n3. Remove nested stack() — use a single pattern layer\n4. Check for common errors:\n   - Missing closing parentheses in method chains\n   - Using note() with drum sample names (drums use s() only)\n   - Using s() without note() for synth sounds (bass/melody need note().s())\n   - Invalid note names (use standard: c4, eb4, g4 — NOT c#4, use db4 instead)\n   - Chaining methods that don't exist in Strudel\n5. When in doubt, output the simplest valid pattern for your instrument and rebuild from there\"\n\n### Per-Agent Additions\n- BEAT: \"Simplest valid drum pattern: s('bd sd').bank('RolandTR909')\"\n- GROOVE: \"Simplest valid bass pattern: note('c1').s('sawtooth').lpf(500).gain(0.6)\"\n- ARIA: \"Simplest valid melody pattern: note('c4 eb4 g4').s('piano').room(0.3).gain(0.6)\"\n- GLITCH: \"Simplest valid FX pattern: s('hh?').room(0.5).hpf(400).gain(0.4)\"\n\n## Files\n- .claude/agents/drummer.md\n- .claude/agents/bassist.md\n- .claude/agents/melody.md\n- .claude/agents/fx-artist.md\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All 4 files have a \u003cdebugging\u003e section\n- Each section includes a \"simplest valid pattern\" for that instrument\n- Common Strudel syntax errors are listed\n- Recovery strategy is clear: simplify, then rebuild\n- Content is per-agent (different instruments have different error modes)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:38:32.212681+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-24T15:34:21.352321+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-09T18:40:30.149881+08:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bsj-qyp","depends_on_id":"bsj-b3m","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:39:15.591088+08:00","created_by":"Desmond"}]}

{"id":"bsj-wfb","title":"Add no_change sentinel handling in agent response processing","description":"# Add no_change Sentinel Handling in Agent Response Processing\n\n## Context\nIn lib/agent-process-manager.ts, applyAgentResponse() (line 403-434) processes each agent's JSON response. Currently, every response must include a valid Strudel pattern string or \"silence\". There's no way for an agent to say \"I'm keeping my current pattern.\"\n\n## Why This Change\nFor organic jams, agents should be able to hold steady when the groove serves the song. The auto-tick system (cc_sick_beats-8n9) will periodically ask agents to listen and optionally evolve. Most of the time, agents should respond with \"no_change\" — stability is the default, not the exception.\n\nWithout this sentinel:\n- Agents must re-output their full pattern every tick (wastes tokens)\n- There's no distinction between \"I chose to keep playing this\" and \"I generated this fresh\"\n- Agents might subtly alter their pattern each tick, creating unwanted drift\n\n## What to Change\n\n### 1. AgentResponse Interface (line 27-32)\nThe pattern field already accepts strings. \"no_change\" is just a new valid value alongside \"silence\" and Strudel code. No interface change needed.\n\n### 2. applyAgentResponse() (line 403-434)\nAdd handling for pattern === \"no_change\":\n```typescript\nif (response) {\n  const pattern = response.pattern || 'silence';\n  if (pattern === 'no_change') {\n    // Keep existing pattern, only update thoughts/reaction\n    this.agentStates[key] = {\n      ...state,\n      thoughts: response.thoughts || '',\n      reaction: response.reaction || '',\n      // Keep status as 'playing' if they had a pattern, otherwise 'idle'\n      status: this.agentPatterns[key] \u0026\u0026 this.agentPatterns[key] !== 'silence' ? 'playing' : 'idle',\n      lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString(),\n    };\n    // Broadcast the thought (agent is communicating even if not changing)\n    this.broadcastAgentThought(key, response);\n    return;  // Don't update agentPatterns[key]\n  }\n  // ... existing logic for new patterns\n}\n```\n\n### 3. broadcastAgentThought() (line 490-503)\nNo change needed — thoughts/reactions broadcast regardless of pattern change.\n\n### 4. composePatterns() (line 449-457)\nNo change needed — it reads from agentPatterns which is untouched for no_change.\n\n## Files\n- lib/agent-process-manager.ts\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Agent responding with {\"pattern\": \"no_change\", ...} keeps its existing pattern playing\n- Agent's thoughts and reaction update even with no_change\n- Agent's status stays \"playing\" if they had a non-silence pattern\n- Agent thought is still broadcast (so UI shows the agent's reasoning)\n- composePatterns() still includes the agent's existing pattern in the stack\n- No TypeScript compilation errors","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:38:46.142017+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-24T15:34:21.343461+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-09T17:55:11.190944+08:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bsj-wfb","depends_on_id":"bsj-omb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-09T17:39:16.639164+08:00","created_by":"Desmond"}]}
