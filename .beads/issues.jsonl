{"id":"cc_sick_beats-aeq","title":"MCP permission bootstrapping delay causes lost jam rounds on fresh Claude CLI process","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen a fresh Claude CLI process starts (first jam session after dev server restart), it takes ~60-90 seconds to negotiate MCP tool permissions one-by-one. During this period:\n\n- The orchestrator receives jam ticks but can only call tools it has already negotiated (e.g. get_jam_state, get_user_messages)\n- It cannot call update_agent_state, execute_pattern, or broadcast_jam_state until those permissions are granted\n- Early jam rounds (1-4) are effectively lost — no agent updates, no pattern execution\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe orchestrator should be able to use all MCP tools from the first jam round.\n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n1. **Pre-warm MCP permissions** — Call each tool once with dummy data during Claude CLI startup (before first jam tick)\n2. **Permission preflight in system prompt** — Instruct Claude to call get_jam_state + get_user_messages immediately on startup to trigger the permission dialog early\n3. **Buffer early ticks** — Queue jam ticks during bootstrapping and replay once all permissions are negotiated\n4. **Investigate --dangerously-skip-permissions** — Check if Claude CLI supports skipping the interactive permission flow for MCP tools defined in config\n\n## Observed During\n\nE2E testing of jam mode (Phase 10). First jam session required waiting through multiple rounds before agent updates appeared. Second jam session (same process) worked immediately.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"choy.desmond@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T14:54:32.588756+08:00","created_by":"Desmond","updated_at":"2026-02-07T15:08:57.363456+08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T15:08:57.363456+08:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["bug","mcp","orchestrator"]}
